## Instructions

QA team should submit bugs via github issues (see above tab)

Requirements and Design documents are available in the /docs folder.  They are
formatted with markdown, as it is simple to edit (it can be done regardless of 
programs installed on your computer, e.g. Microsoft Word, or LaTeX), and it's
visible from within github.

Eclipse code-format settings which were agreed upon by the developers are 
located in the root of this project.
